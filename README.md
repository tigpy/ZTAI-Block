 Where AI judges, and Blockchain Remembers.

## Overview
ZTAI-Block is a unique, AI-powered Zero Trust Access Control system with immutable blockchain logging. This project combines machine learning for intelligent access decisions with blockchain for tamper-proof audit trails. The idea and implementation are original and currently in the initial stage, with plans for advanced features soon.

## Key Features
- **AI-Powered Access Control:** Uses machine learning to make real-time, context-aware access decisions.
- **Blockchain Logging:** Every access event is logged on-chain for transparency and immutability.
- **Modular Architecture:** Clean separation of backend, AI, blockchain, and frontend.

## Tech Stack
- **Python:** Backend API (Flask/FastAPI), AI model training/inference, blockchain deployment scripts
- **ReactJS:** Modern frontend dashboard
- **Solidity:** Smart contracts for access logging
- **Web3.js / web3.py:** Blockchain interaction
- **Jest/React Testing Library:** Frontend testing

## Directory Structure
- `backend/` — API server and business logic
- `ai_model/` — ML model training and prediction scripts
- `blockchain/` — Smart contract and deployment scripts
- `client/` and `frontend/` — React frontends (choose one for production)
- `docs/` — Documentation and architecture diagrams
- `assets/` — Project logo and images

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ZTAI-Block.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   - Backend: See `backend/README.md` (add instructions)
   - Frontend: `cd client && npm install`
   - AI Model: `cd ai_model` and install Python requirements
3. **Run the system:**
   - Start backend, frontend, and blockchain as per your setup
